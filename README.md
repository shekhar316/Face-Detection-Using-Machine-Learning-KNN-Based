# Face Recognisation Using Machine Learning (KNN)

Machine Learning | KNN | Computer Vision | OpenCV

Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. Here, Haar cascades is used to detect the human faces in frame. Then further KNN algorithm is used to recognise the person in that purticular frame.

## Requirements:
* OpenCV
* Haar cascades (XML already included)
* Python3
* Numpy

## Usage:

### 1. Training the model:
* Firstly, clone the repository.
* Install the OpenCV and required libraries.
* Run `collect.py` file using `python collect.py`
* Model will save some images of yours, you can track the progress in terminal. After saving some images, press q to terminate the program. 

### 2. Face Recognisation:
* Run `detect.py` file using `python detect.py` to detect faces in frame.
